  description_en: The NuMaker-HMI-MA35H0 is an evaluation board for Nuvoton NuMicro MA35H0 series microprocessors, and consists of two parts: a NuMaker-HMI-MA35H04F70 board 
                  and a NuMaker-TFT-LCD7 board. The NuMaker-HMI-MA35H0 board integrates core components to simplify the system design, based on MA35H04F767C (LQFP216 package,
                  and stacking a 128 MB DDR), discrete power supply power solution, and one megabit Ethernet PHY. The NuMaker-HMI-MA35H0-A1 has rich peripherals such as 1 set 
                  of megabit Ethernet, USB2.0 high-speed host and device, 1 set of SD2.0 in Micro SD slot, 1 set of SD3.0 in SD slot, 1 set of CAN FD, SPI, I2C, UART, and 2 sets 
                  of RS-485/RS-232 serial communication ports for users to facilitate the evaluation in HMI and industrial control, home appliances, 2-wheel cluster, medical device, 
                  new energy applications, ML (Machine Learning) or your creative applications. The NuMicro MA35H0 series is a multi-core microprocessor targeted to various HMI 
                  applications in the medium resolution. It is based on dual 64/32-bit Arm Cortex-A35 cores, the high-performance cores run up to 650 MHz and include 32/32 KB I/D L1 
                  cache for each core, and a 512 KB shared L2 cache. The MA35H0 series has a built-in 128 KB IBR (Internal Boot ROM) and supports secure booting from four modes, 
                  USB, SD/eMMC, NAND, and SPI Flash (SPI NOR/SPI NAND). In order to provide easy system design and manufacture, the MA35H0 series also offers LQFP package stacked with 
                  a DDR SDRAM and the size up to 128 MB.
